        … You must think that I'm stupid You must think that I'm a fool You must
        think that I'm new to this But I have seen this all before … I'm never
        gonna let you close to me Even though you mean the most to me 'Cause
        every time I open up, it hurts So, I'm never gonna get too close to you
        Even when I mean the most to you In case you go and leave me in the dirt
        …
        <br />
        But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry And every time you leave
        me, the quicker these tears dry And every time you walk out, the less I
        love you Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true …
        <br />
        I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes) I'm way too
        good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes) … I know you're thinking
        I'm heartless I know you're thinking I'm cold I'm just protecting my
        innocence I'm just protecting my soul … I'm never gonna let you close to
        me Even though you mean the most to me 'Cause every time I open up, it
        hurts So, I'm never gonna get too close to you Even when I mean the most
        to you In case you go and leave me in the dirt …
        <br />

        But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry And every time you leave
        me, the quicker these tears dry And every time you walk out, the less I
        love you Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true … I'm
        way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes) I'm way too good
        at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes) No way that you'll see me cry
        (No way that you'll see me cry) I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way
        too good at goodbyes) no …
        <br />
        No, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes) No, no, no, no No, no,
        no (I'm way too good at goodbyes) (No way that you'll see me cry)
        Ah-ah-ah (I'm way too good at goodbyes) … 'Cause every time you hurt me,
        the less that I cry And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears
        dry And every time you walk out, the less I love you Baby, we don't
        stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true I'm way too good at goodbyes
